// This program reduces a singly linked list to a non-decreasing (increasing or equal) sequence
// by repeatedly merging the adjacent pair of nodes with the smallest sum.
// Each merge operation replaces two nodes with a single node whose value is their sum.
// The process continues until the entire list is non-decreasing.
// The method returns the total number of merge operations performed.
