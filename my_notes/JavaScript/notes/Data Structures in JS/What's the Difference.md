# ðŸ”‘ Whatâ€™s the Difference?

## Arrays & Sets:

- Good for **lists**.
- Use **Array** if:
  - You need items in order.
  - You allow duplicates.
  - You want powerful methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`.
- Use **Set** if:
  - You need **unique values only**.
  - You want **high performance** for operations like search or delete.
  - Great for removing duplicates from arrays.

## Objects & Maps:

- Good for **key-value pairs** (like a dictionary).
- Use **Object** if:
  - Youâ€™re working with structured data (like JSON).
  - You need to define methods (functions inside objects).
  - Youâ€™re used to using `.key` or `['key']` syntax.
- Use **Map** if:
  - You want better performance.
  - You want to use **any type** as a key (not just strings).
  - You want to easily loop through entries.
  - You want to know the `.size` easily.
