# 🧠 Where Does Data Come From?

In JavaScript (and web development in general), data usually comes from **3 main sources**:

1. **From the Code Itself**  
   Example: A status message like _“Form submitted successfully”_ written directly in the code.

2. **From the User Interface (UI)**  
   Example: Data typed by a user into a form, or existing data in the page (like tasks in a to-do list).

3. **From External Sources (APIs)**  
   Example: Weather data, movie info, exchange rates, etc.  
   → This is called **fetching data from a Web API**.
