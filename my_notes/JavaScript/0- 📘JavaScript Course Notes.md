# ðŸ“˜JavaScript Course Notes

Welcome to my JavaScript course notes!
These notes were taken while following The Complete JavaScript Course 2025 by Jonas Schmedtmann, and theyâ€™re meant to help me (and maybe you!) revise the core concepts, techniques, and language features of JavaScript.

ðŸ§  I didnâ€™t just take notes while watching Jonasâ€™s course â€” I also spent a lot of time and effort collecting extra information from multiple resources and did my best to organize everything as clearly and perfectly as possible.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repo is part of my learning journey as a developer. I'm documenting everything I learn in JavaScript â€” not only to deepen my own understanding, but also to build a reference I can always return to.
