# 📘JavaScript Course Notes

Welcome to my JavaScript course notes!
These notes were taken while following The Complete JavaScript Course 2025 by Jonas Schmedtmann, and they’re meant to help me (and maybe you!) revise the core concepts, techniques, and language features of JavaScript.

🧠 I didn’t just take notes while watching Jonas’s course — I also spent a lot of time and effort collecting extra information from multiple resources and did my best to organize everything as clearly and perfectly as possible.
