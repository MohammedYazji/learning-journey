## üìå What is Big O Notation?

- A tool in **asymptotic analysis**:
  - It is **one of the notations** used within asymptotic analysis.
  - It shows the **upper bound on the growth rate**:
    - Describes the **worst-case** scenario.
    - So maybe it will take **less** than this, but this is the **maximum**.

#### üß† Example:

If an algorithm is **O(n)**, it means:

- In the **worst case**, it will make up to **n operations**.
- But in other cases, it might:
  - Perform only **n/2** operations,
  - Or even **1** operation.

‚ö†Ô∏è However, in Big O notation, we **ignore constants** like `1` or `n/2` and only care about the **upper bound growth** as `n` increases.

---

## üìö Formal Definition

> An algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operations it performs is eventually less than a constant times `f(n)` as `n` increases.

- `f(n)` could be:
  - Linear ‚Üí `f(n) = n`
  - Quadratic ‚Üí `f(n) = n¬≤`
  - Constant ‚Üí `f(n) = 1`
  - Or something else...

### ‚ö° Quick Visualization:

| **Input size (n)** | **Constant O(1)** | **Linear O(n)** | **Quadratic O(n¬≤)** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1                  | 1 step            | 1 step          | 1 step              |
| 10                 | 1 step            | 10 steps        | 100 steps           |
| 100                | 1 step            | 100 steps       | 10,000 steps        |

üëâ See how fast quadratic (n¬≤) blows up compared to linear (n)? That's why Big-O matters for large inputs.

## üß™ Examples

### 1. Add Up To ‚Äì O(1) and O(n)

- **O(1)** ‚Äì Using a formula:

```python
def add_up_to(n):
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```

- This uses a **mathematical formula** to directly calculate the sum.
- No matter what `n` is (small or huge), it always does **exactly 3 operations**:
  - Multiply `n * (n + 1)`,
  - Divide by 2,
  - Return the result.
- That‚Äôs why its **Big O notation** is **O(1)** ‚ûî it takes **constant time**.

  (It doesn't grow with `n`.)

- **O(n)** ‚Äì Using a loop:

```python
def add_up_to_loop(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total
```

- This **loops** from 1 to `n`, adding each number to `total`.
- The bigger `n` gets, the **more times** it loops.
- If `n = 10`, it loops 10 times.
- If `n = 1,000,000`, it loops 1,000,000 times!
- So the number of operations **depends on `n`**, and grows linearly.
- That's why its **Big O notation** is **O(n)** ‚ûî it takes **linear time**.

---

### 2. Count Up and Down ‚Äì O(n)

```python
def count_up_and_down(n):
    print("Going up!")
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

    print("At the top! Going down...")
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        print(j)

    print("Back down. Bye!")
```

#### Big O Breakdown:

- First loop ‚Üí O(n)

- Second loop ‚Üí O(n)

- Logs ‚Üí O(1)

‚û°Ô∏è Total: **O(n + n + 1)** ‚Üí Drop constants ‚Üí **O(n)**

**‚úÖ Final Big O:** O(n)

Even though there are **two loops**, each looping **n** times,

**we don't say O(2n), we just say O(n)** because Big O ignores constants.

### 3. Print All Pairs ‚Äì O(n¬≤)

```python
def print_all_pairs(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i, j)
```

- Outer loop ‚Üí O(n)

- Inner loop ‚Üí O(n) for each outer loop

- Total: **O(n √ó n) = O(n¬≤)**

| n   | Operations |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | 1          |
| 2   | 4          |
| 3   | 9          |
| 4   | 16         |
| 5   | 25         |

## üßπ Simplifying Big O Expressions

### 1. Constants Don‚Äôt Matter

- O(2n) ‚Üí O(n)
- O(500) ‚Üí O(1)

### 2. Smaller Terms Don‚Äôt Matter

- O(n + 10) ‚Üí O(n)
- O(n + n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n¬≤)

### 3. Big O Shorthand Rules

| Operation                      | Complexity |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Arithmetic ops, assignments    | O(1)       |
| Access by index (array/object) | O(1)       |
| Loop of n iterations           | O(n)       |
| Nested loops                   | O(n¬≤)      |

### Common Complexities

| Complexity | Description                           | Example                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| O(1)       | Constant ‚Äî fixed number of operations | Accessing array by index |
| O(log n)   | Halving input each time               | Binary search            |
| O(n)       | Looping through full input            | Finding max in an array  |
| O(n log n) | Divide + merge or partition           | Merge sort, Quick sort   |
| O(n¬≤)      | Double loop over input                | Comparing all pairs      |
| O(2‚Åø)      | Doubles each time                     | Recursive Fibonacci      |

## üß™ Real Examples

### `logAtLeast5(n)`

```python
def log_at_least_5(n):
    for i in range(1, max(5, n) + 1):
        print(i)
```

- Always prints **at least 5** numbers.
- If `n` > 5, runs up to `n` times.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**

---

### `logAtMost5(n)`

```python
def log_at_most_5(n):
    for i in range(1, min(5, n) + 1):
        print(i)
```

- Never prints **more than 5** numbers.
- Regardless of `n`, it **caps at 5** iterations.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Complexity:** **O(1)**

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Big O** helps formalize how code grows with input.
- We focus on the **worst-case** behavior.
- **Ignore constants**, **ignore smaller terms**.
- Learn to recognize common patterns like **O(1)**, **O(n)**, **O(n¬≤)**, **O(log n)**, and so on.
