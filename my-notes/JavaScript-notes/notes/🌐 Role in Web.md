JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development by making web pages **interactive** and **dynamic**.

## 🧱 The Web’s Core Building Blocks

- **HTML** – Defines the **content** of the webpage  
- **CSS** – Controls the **presentation** (style and layout)  
- **JavaScript** – Adds **interactivity** and **dynamic behavior**

## ⚙️ Where JavaScript Runs

JavaScript can run on **both sides** of a web application:

- **Client-side (in the browser):**  
  - This is the **frontend** — everything the user sees and interacts with.
  
- **Server-side (with Node.js):**  
  - This is the **backend** — handling databases, authentication, APIs, etc.

By working alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript completes the triad that powers the web.
