## 📚 Types of Data

In JavaScript, every value is either a **primitive** or a **reference (object)** type.

---

## 🔢 Primitive vs Reference Types

### 🧱 Primitive Types

- **Types**: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`
- **Stored in**: Call Stack
- **Behavior**:
  - Stored **directly** in the execution context.
  - When assigned to another variable, the **value is copied**.
  - Changing one does **not** affect the other.

### 🧳 Reference Types

- **Types**: Objects, Arrays, Functions (everything else)
- **Stored in**: Heap
- **Behavior**:
  - Variables **store a reference** (memory address) to the actual object in the heap.
  - When assigned to another variable, **both point to the same object**.
  - Modifying one affects the other.

---

## 🧠 How JavaScript Stores Data in Memory

### JavaScript Engine Components

- **Call Stack**: Where functions run and primitives are stored.
- **Heap**: Where objects (reference types) are stored.

## 📦 The 7 Primitive Data Types

1. **Number**  
   Floating point numbers 👉 Used for decimals and integers  
```js
   let age = 23;
```

2. **String**  
    Sequence of characters 👉 Used for text
    
```js
	let firstName = 'Mohammed'
```

3. **Boolean**  
    Logical type that can only be `true` or `false` 👉 Used for decisions
    
```js
	let fullAge = true	
```
    
4. **Undefined**  
    Value of a declared but uninitialized variable
    
```js
	let children;	
```
    
5. **Null**  
    Also means ‘empty value’
    
6. **Symbol** (ES2015)  
    Unique and immutable value — _not commonly used_
    
7. **BigInt** (ES2020)  
    For very large integers beyond `Number` limits
    

> ⚠️ JavaScript has **dynamic typing**:  
> You don’t assign types to variables manually — the type is inferred from the value.

✅ **Values have types**, not variables.


## 📌 Primitive Type Example (Behind the Scenes)

```js
	let age = 30; 
	let oldAge = age; 
	age = 31;
```

### 🔍 Behind the Scenes:

1. `age = 30`:
    - Memory is allocated at address `0001`.
    - `age` points to `0001` adress which contains the value `30`.
2. `oldAge = age`:
    - `oldAge` also points to address `0001`.
3. `age = 31`:
    - New memory is allocated at `0002`.
    - `age` now points to `0002` which contains `31`.
    - `oldAge` still points to `0001`, which still contains `30`.

✅ Final output:

- `age = 31`
- `oldAge = 30`

---

## 🧪 Reference Type Example

```js
const me = { age: 30 };
const friend = me;
friend.age = 27;
```

### 🔍 Behind the Scenes:

1. `me = { age: 30 }`:
    - The object is stored in the **Heap**, say at address `d3f`.
    - `me` holds a reference to that address via the **Call Stack**.
2. `const friend = me`:
    - `friend` also holds the **same reference** to the Heap object (`d3f`).
3. `friend.age = 27`:
    - The change is made **directly in the Heap**.
    - So `me.age` is also `27` because both `me` and `friend` point to the **same object**.

✅ Final output:

- `friend.age = 27`
- `me.age = 27`

⚠️ Note: const does not make objects immutable. It only means the variable cannot be reassigned. Object properties can still be changed.

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember

- **Primitive** = copied by **value**
    
- **Reference** = copied by **reference**
    
- Copying an object usually **does not** create a new object
    
- Use spread or libraries for true copy
    

---

## 🔠 JavaScript is a Dynamic-Typed Language

- JavaScript automatically assigns types to variables based on their assigned values at runtime.
- So the type is defined from the value, not the variable
    - Variables can be reassigned to hold values of different data types (e.g., a variable can switch from having a number to a string).
        - in let case ⇒ can change later
        - in const case ⇒ can not change later

## 🔑 let, const, and var

### ✅ `let`

- Introduced in ES6
    
- Allows **reassignment**
    
- Block-scoped
    
- Good for variables that will change
    
### 🔐 `const`

- Cannot be **reassigned**
    
- Must be **initialized**
    
- Ideal for constants
    
### ⚠️ `var`

- Function-scoped, not block-scoped
    
- Can be **redeclared**
    
- Hoisted — accessible before declaration
    
- Adds to `window` object
    
- Best Practices
    - **Use `const` by default** for variables that do not change.
    - **Use `let` only** when you are sure the variable will change.
        - Minimizing variable mutations reduces the risk of bugs.

❌ Avoid using `var` in modern code.

## 💬 Comments and Type Checking

- **Comments**: Used to document or disable code without deletion. Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.
- **Typeof Operator**: Helps check the type of a value. However, note that `typeof null` incorrectly returns "object", a known bug in JavaScript.
